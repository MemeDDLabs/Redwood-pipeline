6) Total Profit: Total profit across all sniper trades.

7) Win Rate: Percentage of winning trades.

## üìê Custom Fields in Looker Studio (Arb Bot Data)
These fields support trade analysis and a better user experience in the Arbitrage Bot dashboard:

1) buy sell route: Combines buy and sell exchanges into one readable route.

2) Clickable Date: Clickable date linking to Arb Info page filtered by trade ID.

3) Losses: Binary counter for LOSS trades.

4) Token Pair: Summarizes traded tokens, e.g., SOL ‚Üí USDC.

5) Win Loss Label: "WIN" or "LOSS" tag used for visuals and filters.

6) Wins: Binary counter for WIN trades.

7) Win Rate: Percentage of arbitrage trades that were wins.

8) Total Profit: Combined profit across all arbitrage trades.

## üìù Notes
- Dashboards use read-only access to a dedicated Looker Studio Postgres database.

- Visuals include profit analysis, liquidity ratios, token supply, holding duration, partial sell indicators, and more.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è If you access the Arb Info or BTS Info pages directly without a filter applied, the dashboard may display incorrect or misleading data. To view these pages correctly, go to the Bot Dashboard and click on a row. This will redirect you with the correct filter applied.
